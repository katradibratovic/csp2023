    <h1>1.1.9 Project-Lead a Baby Turtle to Sea</h1>
    <img src="119.JPG" height="450" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
      <h3>In this project, Varsha and I created a game that asks the player to solve math problems of <br> 
	      increasing difficulty to try to lead a baby turtle to sea. If the user gets a question wrong, <br>
	      the turtle will be eaten by a predator and the game will restart.</h3>
    <h1> 1.2.5 Project-Mini Minion Run.</h1>
       <img src="125project.png" height="450" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
	<h3>Amber and I created a game where the player tries to move the minion Stuart through a maze <br> 
	      to navigate him back to Gru's house while avoiding the banana peels. We created functions <br>
		throughout our program to avoid duplications of our code and had the program respond to <br>
		user events like clicking the arrows and g key</h3>

    <h1>   Scratch Snoopy Dressup</h1>
    <img src="project3.PNG" height="450" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
      <h3> Hope and I made a game where the player can select different clothes and accesories to dress up<br> 
	      Snoopy with to go to a dance party. We used different costumes, backgrounds, sounds <br>
	       and animations throughout the code to meet the requirements.</h3>
    <h1>   a pHishy Fish Tank.</h1>
      <img src="test.PNG" height="450" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
      <br>
    	<h3>   Atish and I worked to debug and identify breeches in the code of a companies fish tank. We used<br>
		the debugging terminal in VS code to find the bugs and fix them.</h3>

    <h1>4.1.4 Project-Strong Acids and Bases simulation.</h1>
      <img src="Screenshot 2023-11-20 174801.png" height="450" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
    	<h3> Renee and I used Netlogo to investigate a simulation about strong acids and bases <br>
		and how they react together while in a solution. We identified the different turtles <br>
		patches, and randomness throughout the code as well as the inclusions and exclusions in <br>
		the simulation.</h3>
	<h1>Rover Data Project .</h1>
       <img src="marsh.PNG" height="300" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
	<h3> Arshan, Hope and I analyzed data from a lost rover to determine its location on an unknown <br>
		planet. We seperated the data into 4 charts, a light sensor, sound sensor, temperature <br>
		sensor and gyroscope chart. We came to the conclusion that the rover was located in the<br>
		marsh lands, in terms of temperature, we can see a slight and steady climb as the day goes on.<br>
		For gryoscope and light the robot seems to be making different movements except towards the <br>
		end where it reaches a point with drastically more light, likely from a clearing in the marsh. <br>
		The sound is constant because of the background noise from the insects.</h3>

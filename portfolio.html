      <h3>In this project, Varsha and I created a game that asks the player to solve math problems of <br> 
	      increasing difficulty to try to lead a baby turtle to sea. If the user gets a question wrong, <br>
	      the turtle will be eaten by a predator and the game will restart.</h3>
    <h1> 1.2.5 Project-Mini Minion Run.</h1>

	<h3>Amber and I created a game where the player tries to move the minion Stuart through a maze <br> 
	      to navigate him back to Gru's house while avoiding the banana peels. We created functions <br>
		throughout our program to avoid duplications of our code and had the program respond to <br>
		user events like clicking the arrows and g key</h3>

      <h3> Hope and I made a game where the player can select different clothes and accesories to dress up<br> 
	      Snoopy with to go to a dance party. We used different costumes, backgrounds, sounds <br>
	       and animations throughout the code to meet the requirements.</h3>

      <br>
    	<h3>   Atish and I worked to debug and identify breeches in the code of a companies fish tank. We used<br>
		the debugging terminal in VS code to find the bugs and fix them.</h3>

      <img src="Screenshot 2023-11-20 174801.png" height="450" alt="centered image" class="aligncenter">
    	<h3> Renee and I used Netlogo to investigate a simulation about strong acids and bases <br>
		and how they react together while in a solution. We identified the different turtles <br>
		patches, and randomness throughout the code as well as the inclusions and exclusions in <br>
		the simulation.</h3>
